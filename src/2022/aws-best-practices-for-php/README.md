# PHP on AWS: Best Practices to Improve App Performance
In November 2023, we [published an article](https://www.logicata.com/blog/aws-best-practices-for-php/) about the possible optimizations of PHP-FPM. 

To accompany the article, we have also published a [small script](https://github.com/LogicataUK/PhpBoost) to make initial automatic evaluations and generate a configuration automatically.
Over time, the tool ([PhpBoost](https://github.com/LogicataUK/PhpBoost)) has evolved a bit, so we moved it to an independent repository, also to simplify the maintenance.
